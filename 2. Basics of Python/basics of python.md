## Theory

### 1. Python Environment and Interface
The Python environment provides tools and interfaces to write, execute, and debug Python programs. 

**Common Interfaces:**
* **Python Shell:** Basic command-line interface.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** Web-based interactive computing environment.
* **IDEs:** Integrated Development Environments like Spyder, PyCharm, and VS Code.
* **Cloud Platforms:** Google Colab.



### 2. Python Execution Modes
Python supports two main execution modes:

#### a) Interactive Mode
* Commands are executed one line at a time.
* Immediate output is displayed.
* **Use Case:** Testing small code snippets and learning.
* **Examples:** Python shell, Jupyter Notebook cells.

#### b) Script Mode
* Programs are written in a file and executed as a whole.
* Files usually have a `.py` extension.
* **Use Case:** Developing complete applications.

### 3. Comments in Python
Comments are non-executable statements used to explain code and improve readability.

* **Single-line comments:** Begin with `#`
* **Multi-line comments:** Written using triple quotes `"""` or `'''`

### 4. Variables and Identifiers
A variable is a named memory location used to store data values. Python uses dynamic typing, meaning variables do not require explicit data type declaration.
Rules for Identifiers: Must start with a letter (A–Z, a–z) or underscore _.Cannot start with a digit.Identifiers are case-sensitive.Must not be a Python keyword (e.g., if, else, while).

### 5. Data Types in Python
Python provides several built-in data types to store different kinds of data. You can check a type using type().
Data TypeKeywordDescriptionExampleIntegerintWhole numbersx = 10Floating-pointfloatDecimal numbersy = 10.5
StringstrSequence of charactersname = "Python"BooleanboolTrue or Falseis_valid = True

### 6. Operators and Expressions
An expression is a combination of operators and operands that produces a result.
Operator Type Description Symbols Arithmetic Mathematical calculations+, -, *, /, %RelationalComparison>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=LogicalCombining conditionsand, or, notAssignmentAssigning values=, +=, -=, *=, /=BitwiseBit-level operations&

### 7. Basic Input and Output Operations
The input() function is used to accept input from the user.
Note: Input is treated as a string by default and may require type conversion (casting).
Pythonname = input("Enter your name: ")
age = int(input("Enter your age: ")) 
Type conversion to integer
OutputThe print() function is used to display output.Pythonprint("Hello World")
print("Name:", name, "Age:", age)

### Conclusion
Thus, the Python programming environment, execution modes, variables, data types, operators, and basic input/output operations were studied and understood.
