# Experiment 3: Study of List and Various Operations

##  Student Details
* **Name:** Tannishtha Gupta
* **PRN:** 25070123049
* **Batch:** ENTC A3

## Aim
To study the definition, creation, and manipulation of Lists in Python, and to implement various built-in list methods and operations to solve practical problem statements.

## Theory
A **List** in Python is a built-in data structure used to store multiple items in a single variable. Lists are one of the four built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data.

**Key Characteristics of Lists:**
1.  **Ordered:** The items have a defined order, and that order will not change.
2.  **Mutable (Changeable):** We can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.
3.  **Allow Duplicates:** Since lists are indexed, they can have items with the same value.
4.  **Heterogeneous:** A list can contain elements of different data types (Integers, Strings, Booleans, etc.).

## Objectives & Scope
This experiment covers the following operations:
Creation: Defining lists with various data types.
Indexing & Slicing: Accessing elements using positive and negative indices.
Modification: Changing item values, appending, inserting, and extending lists.
Analysis: performing operations like sort(), min(), max(), len(), and sum().

## Code Implementation & Problem Statements
The experiment solves the following 5 specific problem statements:

1. General List Operations
Demonstration of basic functionalities including:
Checking length (len())
Accessing items via index
Reverse indexing
List repetition
Membership testing (in operator)

2. Slicing Analysis
Extracting specific sub-sets of data from a list of numbers:
Extracting elements from index 1 to 3.
Extracting the first three elements.
Extracting elements from index 2 onwards.

3. Student Marks Analysis
Input: A list of student marks. Operations:
Find the Highest Mark.
Find the Lowest Mark.
Calculate the Average Mark.
Sort the marks in ascending order.

4. Grocery List Management
Input: A list of grocery items. Operations:
Extend the list with new items.
Remove specific items (e.g., "Masala").
Display the final updated list.

5. Contact List & Temperature Analysis
Contact List: Managing a list of names by appending new contacts, removing specific names, and sorting them alphabetically.
Temperature Analysis: Analyzing a 10-day temperature dataset to find the first 5 days, last 5 days, highest, lowest, and average temperatures.

## Conclusion
In this experiment, we successfully studied Python Lists. We learned how to create lists, access elements using slicing and indexing, and modify lists using methods like append(), insert(), and remove(). We also applied these concepts to analyze real-world data scenarios like student marks and grocery lists.
