# Experiment 6: Python Conditional Statements

## Student Information

* **Name:** Tannishtha Gupta
* **PRN:** 25070123049
* **Batch & Class:** ENTC A3
* **Subject:** Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering

## Aim of the Study

The objective of this experiment is to master the implementation of conditional control structures in Python. This includes practicing the syntax and logic for `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements, utilizing logical operators for complex conditions (such as leap year calculations), and handling user input to drive program decision-making.

## Problem Statements & Implementation

### 1. Basic Classification

* **Sign Check:**
  Program to identify whether a given number is positive, negative, or zero.

* **Parity Check:**
  Program to determine whether an integer is even or odd using the modulus (`%`) operator.

---

### 2. Comparison Logic

* **Numerical Dominance:**
  Program to find the greater value among two or three user-defined numbers using conditional statements.

---

### 3. Academic Grading System

* Calculates the average marks obtained across **five subjects**.
* Assigns grades based on the calculated average:

  * **Grade A** – Excellent performance
  * **Grade B** – Very good performance
  * **Grade C** – Good performance
  * **Grade D** – Satisfactory performance
  * **Grade E / Fail** – Needs improvement

---

### 4. Calendar & Date Logic

* **Leap Year Identification:**
  Implements the mathematical rules to check whether a given year is a leap year.

* **Date Incrementor:**
  A robust program that:

  * Validates a given date in `DD/MM/YYYY` format
  * Calculates the next day
  * Accounts for different month lengths
  * Handles leap years correctly

---

### 5. Financial Calculations

* **Gross Salary Calculation:**
  Automates the calculation of an employee’s gross salary by applying **HRA** (House Rent Allowance) and **DA** (Dearness Allowance) percentages based on predefined basic salary brackets.

## Conclusion

This experiment successfully demonstrated the use of Python conditional statements to solve real-world problems. Through this exercise, practical applications such as financial calculations, date validation, leap year determination, and academic grading were effectively implemented, strengthening logical thinking and decision-making skills in Python programming.
