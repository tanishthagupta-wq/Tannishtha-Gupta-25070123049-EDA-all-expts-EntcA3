## Theory

### 1. Introduction to Python
Python is a high-level, interpreted, and object-oriented programming language widely used for data analysis, machine learning, automation, and scientific computing.

### 2. What is Anaconda?
Anaconda is a free, open-source distribution of Python and R designed for data science and machine learning.

**Advantages of Anaconda:**
* Comes with Python, Jupyter Notebook, Spyder, and libraries pre-installed.
* Easy package and environment management (`conda`).
* Avoids complex dependency issues.
* Suitable for both beginners and professionals.

### 3. Why Python?
* **Readability:** Python uses simple, English-like syntax.
* **Versatility:** Used in Web Development, Data Science, AI, and Automation.
* **Libraries:** Extensive libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) for data analysis.
* **Community:** Massive open-source community support.

### 4. Why Jupyter Notebook?
* **Interactive:** Allows code execution in individual cells (blocks).
* **Visualization:** Displays plots and graphs directly below the code.
* **Documentation:** Supports Markdown for writing notes alongside code.
* **Exploration:** Ideal for EDA where trial-and-error is common.

## Installation of Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook

### Step 1: Download Anaconda
1.  Visit the official Anaconda website: [https://www.anaconda.com](https://www.anaconda.com)
2.  Click on **Download** and select the **Anaconda Individual Edition**.
3.  Choose the **Python 3.x** version suitable for your operating system (Windows/Mac/Linux).

*(Insert Screenshot of Download Page Here)*

### Step 2: Installation
1.  Run the installer (`.exe` or `.pkg` file).
2.  Follow the on-screen instructions (Agree to license, choose install location).
3.  **Note:** It is generally recommended to "Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable" only if you know what you are doing; otherwise, use the Anaconda Prompt.

### Step 3: Launching Jupyter
1.  Open **Anaconda Navigator** from your start menu.
2.  Click **Launch** under the Jupyter Notebook icon.
3.  Alternatively, open the command terminal and type:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

## Google Colab

Google Colab is a cloud-based Python environment provided by Google (similar to Jupyter Notebooks).

**Advantages:**
* No installation required (runs in the browser).
*  Free access to GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) and TPUs.
*  Easy collaboration (share via Google Drive).
*  Pre-installed libraries.

### Steps to Use Google Colab:
1.  Visit [https://colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com).
2.  Sign in using your Google account.
3.  Click **New Notebook** to start coding.
