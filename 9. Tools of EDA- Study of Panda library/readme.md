## Title Page

**Project Name:** Study of Pandas Library in Python <br/>
**Purpose:** Understanding Data Manipulation and Analysis using Pandas <br/>
**Language:** Python <br/>

---

## Aim of the Study

The aim of this project is to study the **Pandas library** in Python and understand how it is used for data manipulation and analysis.

This project focuses on:

* Creating Series and DataFrames  
* Reading and writing data files  
* Data selection and filtering  
* Handling missing values  
* Performing statistical operations  
* Grouping and sorting data  

---

##  Introduction

Pandas is one of the most important Python libraries used for **data analysis and data manipulation**.

It provides powerful data structures such as:

* Series (1D data structure)  
* DataFrame (2D tabular data structure)  

Pandas is built on top of NumPy and is widely used in:

* Data Science  
* Machine Learning  
* Finance  
* Business Analytics  

It allows easy handling of structured data like CSV files, Excel files, and databases.

##  Study of Pandas (Instructions)

* Import Pandas library  
* Create Series objects  
* Create DataFrame objects  
* Load dataset from CSV file  
* Perform indexing and slicing  
* Filter data using conditions  
* Handle missing values

* Sort and group data  

---

##  Key Concepts Covered

* Importing pandas  
* Series creation

* Reading CSV files  
* Head() and Tail()  
* Indexing (loc and iloc)  
* Filtering data  
* Handling null values  
* Sorting data  
* GroupBy operations  
* Descriptive statistics

# THEORY (Pandas Library)

---

#  Importing Pandas

Pandas is imported using:



import pandas as pd


Here, `pd` is an alias used for convenience.

---

#  Pandas Series

## Definition

A Series is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding data of any type.

### Example:



import pandas as pd

data = pd.Series([10, 20, 30, 40])
print(data)


A Series consists of:

* Values  
* Index  

Custom index can also be provided:



pd.Series([10,20,30], index=["a","b","c"])


---

#  Pandas DataFrame

## Definition

A DataFrame is a two-dimensional, size-mutable, and labeled data structure with rows and columns.

It is similar to a table in a database or an Excel sheet.

### Example:



data = {
"Name": ["A", "B", "C"],
"Marks": [85, 90, 88]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)


---

# Reading Data from CSV File

Pandas allows reading data from external files.



df = pd.read_csv("file.csv")


Common functions:

* `df.head()` → First 5 rows  
* `df.tail()` → Last 5 rows  
* `df.info()` → Information about dataset  
* `df.describe()` → Statistical summary  

---

#  Data Selection and Indexing

## Using loc (label-based indexing)



df.loc[0]


## Using iloc (position-based indexing)



df.iloc[0]


Selecting specific column:



df["Marks"]


Selecting multiple columns:



df[["Name", "Marks"]]


---

#  Filtering Data

Filtering is done using conditions.



df[df["Marks"] > 85]


This returns rows where marks are greater than 85.

---

#  Handling Missing Values

Missing values are common in datasets.

Functions used:

* `df.isnull()`  
* `df.notnull()`  
* `df.dropna()` → Remove missing values  
* `df.fillna()` → Replace missing values  

Example:



df.fillna(0)


---

#  Sorting Data

Sorting data using:



df.sort_values("Marks")


Sorting by multiple columns:



df.sort_values(["Marks", "Name"])


---

#  GroupBy Operation

GroupBy is used to group data based on certain categories.



df.groupby("Department").mean()


It is commonly used in data analysis for aggregation.

---

# Descriptive Statistics

Pandas provides built-in statistical functions:

* `df.mean()`  
* `df.sum()`  
* `df.min()`  
* `df.max()`  
* `df.count()`  
* `df.std()`  

Example:



df["Marks"].mean()

#  Advantages of Pandas

* Easy data handling  
* Powerful data manipulation tools  
* Handles large datasets efficiently  
* Integrates well with NumPy and Matplotlib  
* Essential for Data Science  

---

#  Disadvantages of Pandas

* Requires installation  
* Consumes more memory for very large datasets  
* Slightly complex for beginners  

---

# 🛠 Tools Used

* Python Interpreter  
* Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)  
* VS Code / IDLE  
* Pandas Library  

---

#  Applications of Pandas

* Data Cleaning  
* Data Analysis  
* Financial Analysis  
* Business Reporting  
* Machine Learning Preprocessing  
* Research and Statistics  

---

#  Conclusion

Pandas is a powerful and flexible library used for data analysis in Python.
* DataFrame is the most commonly used Pandas structure  
* Always check missing values before analysis  
* loc is label-based, iloc is position-based  
* head() and describe() are very useful during EDA
