# Experiment 5: To Study Sets and Dictionaries in Python

## Student Details
* **Name:** Tannishtha Gupta
* **PRN:** 25070123049
* **Batch:** ENTC A3

## Aim

The aim of this project is to study **Sets and Dictionaries** in Python and understand the various operations that can be performed on them. This helps in learning how to store, manage, and manipulate data efficiently using these data structures.

---

##  Introduction

**Set** and **Dictionary** are built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data.

- A **Set** stores unique elements and does not allow duplicate values.
- A **Dictionary** stores data in **key–value pairs**, where each key is unique.

Both are widely used in real-world Python applications.

##  Study of Sets and Dictionaries (Instructions)

* Understand what Sets and Dictionaries are
* Learn how to create Sets and Dictionaries
* Perform basic operations on Sets
* Access, update, and delete Dictionary elements
* Use built-in methods of Sets and Dictionaries
* Practice programs regularly to strengthen concepts

---

##  Advantages

###  Advantages of Set
* Stores only unique elements
* Fast membership checking
* Supports mathematical operations
* Useful for removing duplicates
* Unordered data storage

###  Advantages of Dictionary
* Fast data retrieval using keys
* Stores data in structured form
* Keys are unique
* Highly efficient for large data
* Easy to update and modify

---

##  Disadvantages

###  Disadvantages of Set
* Unordered collection
* Does not support indexing
* Mutable but elements must be immutable
* Limited use for ordered data

###  Disadvantages of Dictionary
* Unordered (before Python 3.7)
* Consumes more memory
* Keys must be unique
* Slightly complex syntax for beginners

##  Key Concepts

### Sets
1. Creating a set
2. Adding and removing elements
3. Set operations
4. Unique element storage
5. Built-in set methods

### Dictionaries
1. Key–value pairs
2. Creating dictionaries
3. Accessing values using keys
4. Updating and deleting elements
5. Dictionary methods

---

##  Theory

###  Operations on Set

#### 1. Creating a Set
A set is created using curly brackets `{}`.
Example: `my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4}`

#### 2. Adding Elements
Elements can be added using `add()` method.
Example: `my_set.add(5)`

#### 3. Removing Elements
Elements can be removed using `remove()` or `discard()`.
Example: `my_set.remove(2)`

#### 4. Set Operations
* Union
* Intersection
* Difference
* Symmetric Difference

#### 5. Set Methods
* `add()`
* `remove()`
* `discard()`
* `pop()`
* `clear()`

---

###  Operations on Dictionary

#### 1. Creating a Dictionary
A dictionary is created using curly brackets with key–value pairs.
Example: `my_dict = {"name": "Tanmay", "age": 18}`

#### 2. Accessing Values
Values are accessed using keys.
Example: `my_dict["name"]`

#### 3. Updating Values
Values can be updated using keys.
Example: `my_dict["age"] = 19`

#### 4. Removing Elements
Elements can be removed using `pop()` or `del`.
Example: `del my_dict["age"]`

#### 5. Dictionary Methods
* `keys()`
* `values()`
* `items()`
* `get()`
* `update()`

##  Tools Used

* Python Interpreter
* IDLE
* VS Code
* PyCharm
* Command Prompt / Terminal

---

##  Applications

### Applications of Set
* Removing duplicate values
* Membership testing
* Mathematical set operations
* Data filtering
* Unique data storage

### Applications of Dictionary
* Student records
* Database management
* Configuration settings
* Counting frequency of elements
* Real-time data mapping

---

## Conclusion

Sets and Dictionaries are powerful data structures in Python.  
Sets are best used when **unique values** are required, while Dictionaries are ideal for storing and accessing **key–value based data** efficiently. Understanding these structures improves problem-solving and coding efficiency.

---

##  Extra Notes

* Sets do not allow duplicate values
* Sets are unordered and unindexed
* Dictionary keys must be unique
* Dictionary values can be of any data type
* Both are mutable data structures


## Conclusion
Thus, the concepts of sets and dictionaries in Python were studied. We learned how to handle unique collections using sets and key-value data structures using dictionaries, applying them to solve data filtering and retrieval problems.
